We walked the [Karamatura Loop walk](http://regionalparks.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/huia/track/Karamatura%20Loop%20Walk), a short walk through forest starting just past Huia.

It was a nice walk and we extended it a bit to carry on to the Karamatura Falls, where we got to test our new GoPro.
This last section was a bit more technical, with some clambering over rocks.

There was time to stop in Huia on the way home for an ice cream on the beach.
