A belated post about our holiday to the beautiful Pacific island of Niue.
We left Auckland on Saturday on one of the two flights per week (the only flights to Niue from anywhere) and arrived in Niue on Friday, which was a bit strange.
After picking up our hire car (a bit dated) from the airport we headed to the resort.
This was our first encounter with Niue's roads and can be summed up with one word -- potholes!
Nobody seems to drive on the left hand side of the road, rather swerving all over to avoid the massive potholes that are everywhere.
On the way we passed [Trevor](https://www.facebook.com/thepuddleniueisland/), the only duck on Niue, in his pond (large pothole that the fire service top up with water each day).
The resort was very nice, there were great views and, more importantly, air conditioning in the room.

## Talava Arches and Matapa Chasm

Our first trip was to Matapa Chasm and Telava Arches, two different tracks starting from the same point near Hikutavake on the north western side of the island (pretty much everything to see on Niue is on the coast).

Telava Arches was a short walk on a rocky path through a forest and a short climb though a cave.

We down to Matapa Chasm after getting back from Telava Arches. It was a really impressive spot for swimming, a deep pool with steep walls on each side, lots of fish to see swimming around and a rock at the far end blocking off the open sea.
