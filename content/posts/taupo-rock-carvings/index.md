Gemma and Victoria were going to do Tongariro crossing again but I had injured my ankle so decided to go kayaking instead.

After a quick search I found the Maori Rock Carvings which was an 18 km trip out and back from a kayak hire place on the beach at Taupo.

I had the kayak for 5 hours but didn't hang around and got back in under 3.5. It was a nice day to paddle, with not much wind, and was the longest I had spent kayaking in one go, with only a brief stop at the carvings to take a photo and have something to eat and drink. By the time I returned my back was pretty sore!
