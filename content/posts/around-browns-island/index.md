Setting off from the western end of Mission Bay, I kayaked around Browns Island for the first time.
The weather was stunning, just a very light wind and lots of sun, although it wasn't particularly warm.
There was still a bit of mist in the distance when I set off but it looked like it would burn off soon enough.

Following the buoys along the coast past Kohimarama and St Heliers, I reached Achilles Point in what seemed like no time.
From there I headed out towards Browns Island (you can just make out Browns Island in the image below, surrounded by fog).

The crossing to Browns Island didn't seem to take long and once I got there I kayaked around the island in a clockwise direction.

I didn't stop on the island this time but just headed straight back to the mainland, after a brief stop to wait for some fog to blow away from where I wanted to go.
