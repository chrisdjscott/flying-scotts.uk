One morning in Wanaka, we hired a couple of mountain bikes and cycled out to Lake Hawea and back.
It was a cold start to the day and took us a long time to warm up.

The tracks were well formed and signposted. Apparently the section of track between Albert Town
and the suspension bridge had just been opened a few days earlier. There were great views of the 
mountains in the background most of the way.

We stopped at Hawea for some lunch in front of the lake before heading back the way we came.
