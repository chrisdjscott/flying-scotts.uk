On a short trip up to Bay of Islands we hired a double kayak for a few hours.
The weather was really good and we headed first up the Waitangi river to Haruru falls.

Coming back out of Waitangi river into the bay we headed around a small island to stop on the beach for lunch.

We then made the trip over to Russell and, avoiding the ferries, headed past Russell through lots of moored boats.
We then headed back towards Paihia, admiring the many houses overlooking the bay, passing another couple of small islands.
We were both pretty tired at the end as it was the longest kayak we have done for some time.
