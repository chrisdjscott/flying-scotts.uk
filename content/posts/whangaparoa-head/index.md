After unloading the kayaks at Matakatia beach, driving across to the finish point at Tindalls Beach and walking back to the start point, we set off for a kayak around Whangaparoa Head.

During the first half we were quite exposed to the wind and it got a bit choppy. After going around the head we were sheltered from the wind and it was a very pleasant paddle back.
