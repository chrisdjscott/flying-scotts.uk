We finally bought Gemma a kayak too - a (very) old Puffin - and this was our first trip out together.
We went from French Bay, which is only a 5-10 minute drive from home, and is very nice to paddle from when the wind and tide are OK.

We hugged the coast on the way to Blockhouse Bay, looking at all the little beaches and bays along the way, and then took a more direct route on the way back.

Check out the colour coordination from Gemma.
