We hired mountain bikes near the finish and they dropped us off at the start for the long cycle back.
They'd given us a code to lock the bikes up so we weren't in a rush to get back before they closed.
There was a good climb in the first half and it rained quite heavily during that part but eventually cleared up and was a nice day.
