We spent a nice weekend away in the Coromandel, near Whitianga. We arrived on the Saturday and walked out to Cathedral Cove.

It was busy but there were amazing views, especially from the side track to the lookout.

We also paid a quick visit to Gemstone Bay.

The next day we went on a kayak tour around the same area. It was a bit colder that day and we were glad to have a hot chocolate on the beach at the half way point.
