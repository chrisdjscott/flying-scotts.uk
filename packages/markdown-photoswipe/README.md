# Markdown photoswipe plugin

* Display thumbnail on the post page instead of full image
* Sets image title to alt, if title not set
* Can set class of image
* Clicking the thumbnail opens full image in photoswipe (must add javascript code to template separately)
* Requires thumbnail-generator plugin to create the thumbnails
