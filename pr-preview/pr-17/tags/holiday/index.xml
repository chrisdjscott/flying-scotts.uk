It was a cold start to the day and took us a long time to warm up.
We set out from Wanaka and cycled along a trail following the edge of the lake.
When we reached the lake outlet the trail passed through a campsite we had stayed in previously, after which it narrowed down for a more technical section.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twin Coast Cycle Trail</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2020/11/22/twin-coast-cycle-trail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2020/11/22/twin-coast-cycle-trail/</guid><description>&lt;section id='post-route-0' class="gpx" data-gpx-source="twin-coast-cycle-trail.gpx" data-map-target='post-map-0' data-title='Twin Coast Cycle Trail'&gt;

The weather was really good and we headed first up the Waitangi river to Haruru falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back out of Waitangi river into the bay we headed around a small island to stop on the beach for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Niue</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/10/6/niue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/10/6/niue/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A belated post about our holiday to the beautiful Pacific island of Niue.
We left Auckland on Saturday on one of the two flights per week (the only flights to Niue from anywhere) and arrived in Niue on Friday, which was a bit strange.
After picking up our hire car (a bit dated) from the airport we headed to the resort.
This was our first encounter with Niue&amp;rsquo;s roads and can be summed up with one word &amp;ndash; potholes!
Nobody seems to drive on the left hand side of the road, instead there are cars swerving all over to avoid the massive potholes that are everywhere.
On the way we passed &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepuddleniueisland/"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, the only duck on Niue, in his pond (large pothole that the fire service top up with water each day).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gold Coast</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/1/13/gold-coast/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/1/13/gold-coast/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gemma had to go to Gold Coast for work so we decided to head out together a few days early and have a look around.
We went on a boat trip to Moreton Island and did some snorkelling around some ship wrecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island was stunning and we spent some time on a beautiful beach.
The snorkelling was really cool and we got to see lots of fish and coral around the wrecks (see video below).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
