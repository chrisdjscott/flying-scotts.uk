We set off from the Horsman Road entrance and turned left early on to head towards the Constable Road entrance.
These wide, gravel tracks have recently been upgraded to try and prevent Kauri dieback from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed over the suspension bridge and did an out and back section up to the other entrance, before heading down to &lt;a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/auckland/places/muriwai-and-te-henga-area/tracks/mokoroa-stream-track/"&gt;Mokoroa stream&lt;/a&gt; for the return leg.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Niue</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/10/6/niue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/10/6/niue/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A belated post about our holiday to the beautiful Pacific island of Niue.
We left Auckland on Saturday on one of the two flights per week (the only flights to Niue from anywhere) and arrived in Niue on Friday, which was a bit strange.
After picking up our hire car (a bit dated) from the airport we headed to the resort.
This was our first encounter with Niue&amp;rsquo;s roads and can be summed up with one word &amp;ndash; potholes!
Nobody seems to drive on the left hand side of the road, instead there are cars swerving all over to avoid the massive potholes that are everywhere.
On the way we passed &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepuddleniueisland/"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, the only duck on Niue, in his pond (large pothole that the fire service top up with water each day).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wairoa Loop Track</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/9/8/wairoa-loop-track/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/9/8/wairoa-loop-track/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back to the Hunua Ranges for another run, this time on the Suspension Bridge and Wairoa Loop tracks. The start of the Suspension Bridge track was steep and slow but the narrow track through the forest was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the steep climb up this track, there was a steep descent down towards Wairoa Reservoir. On the way down there was a nice lookout point.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pukapuka Track loop</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/30/pukapuka-track-loop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/30/pukapuka-track-loop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It was a cold start to the morning as we headed over to the Hunua Ranges to go for a run on some new trails.
The temperature dropped to -2° at the lowest point and it was quite misty when we arrived.
We set off from the car park below Upper Mangatawhiri Dam, through the campsite and onto A.R.A. Drive.
A short way along there we turned off onto River Track, which was more interesting than the road, and included a little stream crossing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ernies Track loop</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/16/ernies-track-loop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/16/ernies-track-loop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Another set of weekend night shifts for Gemma and another trip to the Hunua Ranges for me.
This time I headed to the Upper Mangatawhiri Reservoir, parking below the dam near the campsite, to do the Ernies Track loop.
I did the loop in a clockwise direction, which I think was a good decision.
This way, most of the downhill was on wide, open track, while the uphill was steep and technical.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hunua Falls loop</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/9/hunua-falls-loop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2018/6/9/hunua-falls-loop/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With Gemma sleeping after a night shift I decided it would be best to get out of the house and headed down to the Hunua Ranges for the first time.
Starting from Hunua Falls, I did a loop around Cosseys Gorge track and Massey track.
It was a popular spot, with a full car park and lots of people, at least around the waterfall area.
After passing through the Kauri dieback cleaning station I headed out on the Cosseys Gorge track, doing the loop in a clockwise direction.
Near the beginning, there was a little stream crossing, followed by a nice run beside a river and a gentle climb up towards the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Round the Mountain</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2017/11/23/round-the-mountain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2017/11/23/round-the-mountain/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We had an early start this morning for the drive from Tekapo to Akaroa, near Christchurch.
We arrived around midday and after a bite to eat and a quick stroll through the town we decided to run/walk around the &lt;a href="https://www.bankspeninsulawalks.co.nz/akaroa-walks/"&gt;Round the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; track.
This gave me a chance to try running with my new backpack and Inov-8 Roclite 325 shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;
&lt;a data-index="0" data-size="1920x1440" data-title="We felt old going up this hill" href="../../2017/11/23/round-the-mountain/001_feeling-old.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb out of Akaroa was steep and went on for a long time.
We certainly felt old on the way up (see photo).
Running in the middle of the day wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal and we were suffering from the heat.
Thankfully we were rewarded with great views from the top.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rangitoto Run</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2016/6/6/rangitoto-run/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2016/6/6/rangitoto-run/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We took advantage of a public holiday (the Queen’s birthday) to head over to Rangitoto Island, a
25 minute ferry journey from Auckland. Rangitoto is a volcanic island that last erupted around
600 years ago. We took our running kit and, following a route we found online, ran up to the
summit, did a loop around to some lava caves and back up to the summit again. The views from the
top were amazing, with great views of Auckland and the surrounding area. Not bad for winter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Haruru Falls Run</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2016/5/21/haruru-falls-run/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/2016/5/21/haruru-falls-run/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We spent a long weekend in the Bay of Islands for Gemma&amp;rsquo;s birthday and on one day we went for a run to Haruru Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way out was on really nice trails through a forest and along a river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the waterfall we saw some chickens chasing each other around the car park.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
