The weather was really good and we headed first up the Waitangi river to Haruru falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back out of Waitangi river into the bay we headed around a small island to stop on the beach for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exploring Browns Island</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/12/3/exploring-browns-island/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/12/3/exploring-browns-island/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The weather was looking really calm and we both had the day off so we loaded the kayaks onto the car and headed over to St Heliers, to kayak around Browns Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really smooth paddle over to Browns Island.
We approached the western side of the island and then started around the island in a clockwise direction.
We landed at Crater Bay, on the north-eastern corner, and had the beach to ourselves to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Akaroa Kayak with Dolphins</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/11/24/akaroa-kayak-with-dolphins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/11/24/akaroa-kayak-with-dolphins/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On the final day of our holiday in the South Island we went &lt;a href="http://akaroakayaks.com/sunrise-wildlife/"&gt;kayaking&lt;/a&gt; near Akaroa.
The weather was a bit cloudy but that was good as it would hopefully keep us a bit cooler.
We got out in our kayak first and while waiting for the others we heard a lot of screaming coming from the shore.
It turns out a couple of the people realised they were afraid of the water; we were lucky they gave up in the end otherwise it would have been a very slow trip.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lake Wanaka Kayak</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/11/20/lake-wanaka-kayak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/11/20/lake-wanaka-kayak/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After two big walks in two days our legs were feeling very tired, so we decided to give them a rest and do some kayaking.
We hired a double kayak and set off on a very peaceful and stunning day on Lake Wanaka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paddled up the edge of the lake and then cut across to Ruby Island.
We did a full circuit of the island and then landed on a beach and had a look around and walked to the top of the island.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cathedral Cove</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/9/24/cathedral-cove/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/9/24/cathedral-cove/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We spent a nice weekend away in the Coromandel, near Whitianga. We arrived on the Saturday and walked out to Cathedral Cove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was busy but there were amazing views, especially from the side track to the lookout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also paid a quick visit to Gemstone Bay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Around Browns Island</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/6/17/around-browns-island/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/6/17/around-browns-island/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Setting off from the western end of Mission Bay, I kayaked around Browns Island for the first time.
The weather was stunning, just a very light wind and lots of sun, although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly warm.
There was still a bit of mist in the distance when I set off but it looked like it would burn off soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the buoys along the coast past Kohimarama and St Heliers, I reached Achilles Point in what seemed like no time.
From there I headed out towards Browns Island (you can just make out Browns Island in the image below, surrounded by fog).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Whangaparoa Head</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/6/11/whangaparoa-head/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/6/11/whangaparoa-head/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After unloading the kayaks at Matakatia beach, driving across to the finish point at Tindalls Beach and walking back to the start point, we set off for a kayak around Whangaparoa Head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first half we were quite exposed to the wind and it got a bit choppy. After going around the head we were sheltered from the wind and it was a very pleasant paddle back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>French Bay Kayak</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/5/28/french-bay-kayak/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/5/28/french-bay-kayak/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We finally bought Gemma a kayak too - a (very) old Puffin - and this was our first trip out together.
We went from French Bay, which is only a 5-10 minute drive from home, and is very nice to paddle from when the wind and tide are OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hugged the coast on the way to Blockhouse Bay, looking at all the little beaches and bays along the way, and then took a more direct route on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Milford to Long Bay</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/5/6/milford-to-long-bay/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/5/6/milford-to-long-bay/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This was the longest kayak I have done so far. We went from the north end of Milford Beach all the way up the coast to Long Bay and back. The weather was perfect, with clear blue skies and the sea was almost flat. The coast was quite impressive in places, with lots of cliffs with houses perched on the edge (they must have some amazing views). There were also lots of slips from the recent bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taupo Rock Carvings</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/3/2/taupo-rock-carvings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2017/3/2/taupo-rock-carvings/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gemma and Victoria were going to do Tongariro crossing again but I had injured my ankle so decided to go kayaking instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;
&lt;a data-index="0" data-size="1920x1425" data-title="Lake Taupo" href="../../pr-preview/pr-17/2017/3/2/taupo-rock-carvings/003_landing.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick search I found the Maori Rock Carvings which was an 18 km trip out and back from a kayak hire place on the beach at Taupo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the kayak for 5 hours but didn&amp;rsquo;t hang around and got back in under 3.5. It was a nice day to paddle, with not much wind, and was the longest I had spent kayaking in one go, with only a brief stop at the carvings to take a photo and have something to eat and drink. By the time I returned my back was pretty sore!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Waiheke Kayak</title><link>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2016/12/30/waiheke-kayak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>user@example.com (Chris Scott)</author><guid>https://www.flying-scotts.uk/pr-preview/pr-17/2016/12/30/waiheke-kayak/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On one of our days off over the Christmas break we headed to Waiheke Island and went on a guided kayak tour with &lt;a href="http://www.kayakwaiheke.co.nz/"&gt;Kayak Waiheke&lt;/a&gt;. We ended up in a double kayak and there was one other pair on the trip with us. The weather was perfect and there was amazing scenery as we kayaked along the coast. There were some incredible houses on the cliff tops overlooking the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="post-photos"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for lunch on a stunning little beach, which we had to ourselves. There was even time to go for a short swim in the sea before heading back the way we came.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
