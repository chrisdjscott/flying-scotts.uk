Would allow having multiple maps per page

But how to choose which photos go on which map - just put all photos on them all to begin with?

can only include the map js/css if the shortcode is in play

remove gpx from front matter but leave in lat/long/zoom

map shortcode will take gpx as optional argument
- if set then use it
- otherwise take the lat/long/zoom from page variables and use those

also title for gpx as argument

need to deal with post-map and post-route, have a number them and pass as arg to map js
